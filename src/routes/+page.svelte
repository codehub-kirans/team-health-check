<h1>Welcome to the Team Health Check App!</h1>
<article>
	<p>
		The health check app has a set of questions on themes for the team to discuss and capture their
		sentiment about each theme. For each question, the squad is asked to discuss if they are closer
		to “awesome” or closer to “crappy”, and we use basic workshop techniques (dot voting, etc) to
		help them reach consensus about which color to choose for that indicator, and what the trend is
		(stable, improving, or getting worse).For example, the theme "can we release easily?" might
		elicit responses of "our releases are awesome/meh/crappy" i.e. green, amber and red, the colours
		of a traffic light.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b style="color: green;">GREEN</b>: Things are going very well. Although this does not mean that
		everything is perfect the team or squad is satisfied and does not see much space for
		improvement. <br />
		<b style="color:darkkhaki;">YELLOW</b>: There are some problems that need to be solved. However,
		it is not a disaster.
		<br />
		<b style="color: red;">RED</b>: There is a lot going wrong. Improvements are urgently needed.
		<br />
	</p>
	<p>
		The app collects input from everyone in real time and results are instantly tallied. The app can
		also keep a track of the squads progress over time without the need for manual collation. Sort
		responses by most positive, most negative or most mixed and facilitate better discussions.
